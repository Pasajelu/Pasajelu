Some time ago I installed an early version of OCLP in an old Mac with no problem & excellent results.
Now I'm trying to upgrade a 2012 MacMini running up-to-date Catalina, to Sequoia with OCLP 2.0.1.
I need help because I'm stuck in a loop. The Option-Boot of my installation RAM stick always ends booting Catalina.
I can do a Boot-to-Safe-Mode with Catalina. It took an hour to complete. Seems very strange.
I have disconnected all other external drives the 2nd display, and the USB hub. The installion Ram stick is mounted directly in the MacMini.
This model MacMini has 2 internal drives, both SSD 1TB. 16GB RAM. I run Titanium Software's Onyx for maintainance.
Before my last attempt I ran the Onyx utility app to see what I might remove. Looking at Applications, I was surprised at the large number 
listed that were so old that they are no longer compatible with Catalina. (They did not show up in the finder.) I deleted them.
There were also a number of duplicates listed--which didn't show in Finder. I also deleted them. Makes no difference. Simply will not Option-Boot
into Sequoia.
